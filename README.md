# Decision Governance & MRU

This repository proposes a decision governance layer for automated systems.

Instead of deciding what actions to take, this layer governs whether automation
is allowed to continue.

Automation needs brakes, not just engines.

## What This Is
- A governance specification
- A decision permission model
- A safety-oriented control layer

## What This Is Not
- An autonomous agent
- A decision optimizer
- A business logic framework
- An execution system

## Status
Draft / Experimental
